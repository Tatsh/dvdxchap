2004-11-07 Moritz Bunkus
 * released v1.4.2.
 - dvdxchap accepts a range of chapters to output and adjusts the
   timestamps. Patch by Olivier Rolland.
 - ogmcat accepts files that contain a single track whose serial nubmers
   don't match. This is the case for audio-only Ogg files.

2004-08-03 Moritz Bunkus
 * released v1.4.1.
 - Updated avilib to handle OpenDML AVIs bigger than 1Gb created by mencoder.

2004-04-14 Moritz Bunkus
 * released v1.4.
 - The MPEG4 key frame detection was broken resulting in unseekable files.
	
2004-04-13 Andre Hinrichs
 - Fixed some typos.

2004-04-05 Moritz Bunkus
 * released v1.3.

2004-04-01 Moritz Bunkus
 - Added an option for using external AVI index files as generated by
   transcode's aviindex tool (patch by Andrew de Quincey).
 - Always regenerate key frames for AVI files if it's a MPEG4 codec.

2004-03-29 Moritz Bunkus
 - Updated avilib from transcode's current CVS version.

2004-02-10 Moritz Bunkus
 - Fixed a bug with the '-T' option to ogmmerge and following SRT files.

2003-12-15 Andre Hinrichs
 - Output files of ogmdemux are written to current directory.

2003-11-20 Moritz Bunkus
 * released v1.2.
 - Implemented reading older OGM files with the broken stream headers
   produced by ogmmerge < 1.1. Re-merging should be enough to fix
   the headers.

2003-11-12 Moritz Bunkus
 - Improved MP3 and AC3 detection.

2003-10-28 Moritz Bunkus
 * released v1.1.
 - ogmdemux skips empty packets in the text subtitle streams.

2003-10-23 Moritz Bunkus
 - Updated the avilib to the latest version from mkvtoolnix which in turn
   is a slightly modified version from transcode 0.6.10. It should be able
   to handle OpenDML AVIs.
 - Added a --summary option to ogminfo which will display the size,
   bitrate, number of packets/frames and total length in seconds for each
   track.
 - Added an option, --omit-empty-packets, that will suppress the
   creation of empty subtitle packets.
 - When splitting files the second and all following files have a new
   chapter entry starting at 00:00:00 which is marked with
   "(continued)". Patch by Marco Zühlke <M.Zuehlke AT freenet.de>.
 - Improved OS/X and BSD/OS compatibility (thanks for the patch to
   Steven M. Schultz <sms AT 2BSD.COM>).
 - Fixed the OGM stream headers again - they wouldn't play back on Windows,
   and they would be broken on big endian systems.

2003-05-20 Moritz Bunkus
 * released v1.0.3
 - Fixed a bug in avilib.

2003-05-05 Moritz Bunkus
 * released v1.0.2

2003-05-04 Moritz Bunkus
 - Imported changes that make the ogmtools compile and work under FreeBSD
   (and possibly under other BSD variants as well); patch by
   Andrew Williams <andrew.s.williams AT adelaide.edu.au>.

2003-05-01 Moritz Bunkus
 - Lots of fixes for endian handling (thanks for the large patch to
   Andreas Schwab <schwab AT suse.de>).
	
2003-04-25 Moritz Bunkus
 - Fixed a segfault in ogmdemux (thanks to Tilmann Bitterberg).
 - Made the OGM reader more error resiliant if the file is damaged.

2003-03-04 Moritz Bunkus
 - Fixed a bug in the subtitle packager which would discard the last
   character on each subtitle entry.

2003-03-01 Moritz Bunkus
 * released v1.0.0 
 - Newlines in subtitles are converted to DOS style newlines (\r\n) as
   some Windows players (e.g. BSPlayer) do not cope with a single \n.
 - ogminfo in verbosity mode 2 or above also shows the bitrate in kbit/s
   and KB/s for each stream.

2003-01-21 Moritz Bunkus
 - Some small speedups in the AVI reader.

2003-01-14 Moritz Bunkus
 * released v0.973
 - Hopefully fixed some timestamp issues with the autotools stuff.

2003-01-13 Moritz Bunkus
 - Added support for MicroDVD subtitles.

2003-01-03 Moritz Bunkus
 * released v0.972
 - Added new comment handling for ogmmerge (see man page search for '-c').

2002-12-14 Moritz Bunkus
 - Fixed a bug in ogmdemux which would segfault if its output files could
   not be opened (thanks to Nicolas Vignal <nicolas.vignal AT fnac.net>).

2002-12-13 Moritz Bunkus
 - Fixed a bug in avilib that causes more calls to read/seek than
   necessary (fix contributed by Peter Niemayer <niemayer AT isg.de>).
 * released v0.970
 - Fixed a bug in ogmsplit's command line parser: '-s' was misinterpreted
   if an unit other than 'b' was appended to the size.
 - Fixed a bug in ogmmerge with stream selection when reading from an
   OGM: "-a 1" would work, but "-a 2" (and higher, same for video/text
   streams) would not.
 - Changed ogminfo's output to include the stream's serial number instead
   of the total number of streams found so far.

2002-11-30 Moritz Bunkus
 - Fixed another bug in ogmdemux where not enough memory was allocated
   for filenames (thanks to Robert Wal <rrw AT hell.pl>).
 - Fixed a bug in ogmmerge: -T was not reset once used (thanks to
   Rober Wal <rrw AT hell.pl>).

2002-11-23 Moritz Bunkus
 - Modified the verbosity levels ogminfo supports (see man page for a
   full listing).

2002-11-19 Moritz Bunkus
 - Added new program 'ogmcat' that can concatenate several OGG/OGM files
   into one file using various methods to keep audio/video synchronization.

2002-11-13 Moritz Bunkus
 * released v0.960
 - Added MP3 audio synchronization.
 - Moved the AC3 audio synchronization code from the AC3 reader to
   the AC3 packetizer. Otherwise synchronization worked only if the
   source was AC3 files, not for e.g. AVIs or OGMs.
 - Added a new option '-f' to ogmmerge that can be used to force the
   video FourCC to a specific value (thanks to Robert Wal <rrw AT hell.pl>
   for the suggestion).
 - Fixed a bug in ogmmerge: chapter information was dropped if
   the source was an OGM file (thanks to Robert Wal <rrw AT hell.pl>).
 - Fixed a bug in ogmmerge: if badly formatted subtitles were reported
   trash was shown at the end of the shortened entries (thanks to
   Robert Wal <rrw AT hell.pl>).
 - Fixed a bug in ogmdemux: too few characters were allocated for file
   names resulting in file names that contained garbage (thanks to...
   well, just guess ;)... Robert Wal <rrw AT hell.pl>).

2002-10-24 Moritz Bunkus
 * released v0.954
 - Applied a patch by Kresimir Kukulj <madmax AT iskon.hr> that
   relaxes the SRT recognition a bit - the chapter strings do
   not have to start with CHAPTER01= anymore. The numbers
   may be higher.

2002-10-19 Moritz Bunkus
 - Applied a patch by Peter Niemayer <niemayer AT isg.de> that enables
   AC3 sync by removing/duplicating whole AC3 packets.
 - Added 'nice(2)' to all programs :)
 - Fixed several number format bugs in the subtitle processor.
 - The Vorbis packetizer no longer forces flushing of pages. This
   removes unwanted 'popping' noise in some rare cases.
 - Fixed the output of ogminfo's -v -v mode: it now reports the exact
   position on which a new OGG page begins along with its length.

2002-10-01 Moritz Bunkus
 * released v0.951
 - ogmsplit now honors the user's choice of file extensions and reuses
   either the extension given with -o or, if no -o is present, the
   input file's extension. Only if the name given with -o contains
   no extension '.ogm' is used. All other utilities do not append
   any extension on their own.

2002-09-30 Moritz Bunkus
 * released v0.950
 - Added support for chapter information as generated by 'dvdxchap' and
   other Windows programs to ogmmerge and ogmsplit.

2002-09-29 Moritz Bunkus
 - Fixed the 'cut mode' so it will end after the given time, which does
   not have to be at a key frame boundary.
 - Added progress output to ogmsplit (only if no verbose output is wanted).

2002-09-23 Moritz Bunkus
 - Committed a patch to ogmsplit written by Adam Sampson <azz AT gnu.org>
   that adds a 'cut mode' to ogmsplit (see man page).
 - Added RPM spec file contributed by Marc Lavallée <odradek AT videotron.ca>.

2002-09-22 Moritz Bunkus
 - Introduced a first pass that finds split points in ogmsplit.
   This will of course lengthen the splitting process, but it is
   necessary in order to handle chapter information correctly.

2002-09-18 Moritz Bunkus
 - Cleanups for the man pages and each program's --help output.
 - Added new program 'dvdxchap' that can extract chapter information
   from DVDs and print them in a format that can be used with
   ogmmerge.

2002-09-17 Moritz Bunkus
 - Documentation moved from README to the man pages.

2002-09-16 Moritz Bunkus
 * released v0.93
 - Added option '-p' to ogmsplit that causes ogmsplit just to print
   the time stamp and output position just before each key frame.
 - Support for AC3 audio from external files, AVI and OGM files.
   Still needs testing.
 - Tobias Waldvogel (author off OggDS) convinced me that subtitle
   page's granulepos values are correct the way they are now.
   Please ignore the '...(buggy) OggDS behaviour' mentioned below.
 - Comitted a patch from Jason Lunz which updates some of the
   Debian files.

2002-09-14 Moritz Bunkus
 * released v0.922
 - Changed the video packet output: each keyframe starts on a new
   OGG page. This improves seeking in MPlayer and enlarges the
   file only marginally (17KiB for a 700MiB file).
 - Fixed DOS newlines in various files (prevented sucessful compilation
   on some systems).
 * released v0.921
 - Changed the subtitle packet ordering to emulate the (buggy)
   OggDS behaviour.
 * released v0.92
 - Fixes for ogmsplit - split after a certain amount of written
   data or after an elapsed time.

2002-09-12 Moritz Bunkus
 - Added support for MP3 audio. Can be read from a separate file,
   from an AVI or from an OGM.
 - Added a new tool, ogmsplit, that will split before a keyframe
   around a given size.
 - Fixed page ordering: pages are now output depending on their
   start time (which is the stream's previous granulepos), not on
   their current granulepos.
 - Fixed ogminfo to check the page's start time (see point above)
   for 'sync_ok'/'OUT_OF_SYNC'.
 - Fixed some bugs with ogminfo's output.
 - Removed ogmsplit.pl because ogmsplit does a much better and
   much faster job.
 - Added Debian patch from Marc Leeman to my 'official' sources.

2002-08-26 Moritz Bunkus
 * released v0.901
 - Fixed a small bug: if a WAV file should be read it was parsed as
   a SRT file as well.

2002-08-24 Moritz Bunkus
 * released v0.9
 - ogminfo does now output the file position in bytes for each
   OGG page if the verbosity level is 3 or higher.
 - Added a small Perl script called ogmsplit.pl that attempts to
   split an OGM file after a specified size in megabytes.

2002-08-23 Moritz Bunkus
 - Fixed some bugs with subtitle support. Should work now.
 - Changed the granulepos calculation for some stream types. It
   should now more closely resemble the way OggDS calculates it.
 - Changed ogminfo's output format and included some more information.

2002-08-17 Moritz Bunkus
 - Mandatory comment packets are now created, and the user can
   specify his/her own comments using '-c "TAG1=Value#TAG2=Another Value'
   syntax.
 - Included avilib in the ogmmerge sources (thanks to Robert Wal
   for the patch).
 
2002-08-15 Moritz Bunkus
 - First support for SRT subtitles in ogmmerge.

2002-08-14 Moritz Bunkus
 - ogmdemux now extracts streams to useful formats:
   video to AVI, text streams to text files (SRT format),
   Vorbis audio to OGGs, PCM audio to WAV files.
   All other audio formats are still just copied 1:1.
 - ogminfo can correctly handle text streams (subtitles).

2002-08-02 Moritz Bunkus
 * released v0.8
 - added audio synchronization for linear drifts
 - added the option to process only a specific range

2002-07-30 Moritz Bunkus
 * released v0.7
  - added audio synchronization by adding silence/removing packets
    at the beginning of an audio stream

2002-07-28 Moritz Bunkus
 * released v0.6
  - ogmmerge completely written in C++
  - support for reading AVIs (including audio tracks)
  - support for reading OGG files (Vorbis-only and those produced
    by ogmmerge itself)
  - fixed some packet ordering issues

2002-07-24 Moritz Bunkus
 * released v0.501
  - fixed a bug in vorbis.c with not initialized structures

2002-07-24 Moritz Bunkus
 * released v0.5
